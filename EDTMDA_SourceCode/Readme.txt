EDTMDA works on Python 3.6 (tested on Windows 10 Home x64, Intel Python 3.6.4).

The specific steps are shown as follows:

(1) EDTMDA requires  numpy, scikit-learn and pandas to run. Please make sure they have been installed.

(2) Please run EDTMDA.py to run the program (Remember not to change the file path).

(3) You will obtain¡®prediction results for all unknown samples.xlsx¡¯, where the disease, miRNA, and score corresponding to the unknown sample are shown in each row.
